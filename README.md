# Fisher-Information-in-Linearised-Networks

This repository contains some of the code used for analysis of Fisher information in linearised networks from Chadwick et al. (2022). The file AnalyseNetworkJacobian.m creates an instance of the Stabilised Supralinear Network (SSN), finds a stimulus-driven fixed point, linearises the system about that fixed point, and computes the Fisher information and SNR along left eigenvectors of the Jacobian.
